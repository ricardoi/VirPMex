# Bioinformatic scripts for the 
## Analysis fo Viromes

##### Author: Ricardo I. Alcala PhD

### List of scripts 
#### High Throughput Sequencing for Viromes
1. Remove sequence adapters from Illumina reads using cutadapt[go to script](https://github.com/ricardoi/VirPMex/blob/main/scripts/cut_adapt.sh)
2. Filtering the host read sequences using the host reference genome using bowtie [go to script](https://github.com/ricardoi/VirPMex/blob/main/scripts/host_genomeseqs-removal.sh)
3. 
4. Cuatro

#### Virome -hybrid- assembly using Sanger and Illumina reads 
1. If you have the .ab1 sequences transform it to fastq [go to script](https://github.com/ricardoi/VirPMex/blob/main/scripts/abi2fastq.sh)
2. Assembly the host-free Illumina reads and the Sanger sequences [go to script](https://github.com/ricardoi/VirPMex/blob/main/scripts/Spades_metaviralassembler.sh)
